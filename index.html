    <p> My name is Cayden Prather. Currently finish up the CSC102 class with Professor Coddington at UAT!</p>
    <p> I have always been pationate about coding, and found UAT to be an amazing place to help build my knowledge and prepare me for a future career.</p> 
    <p> The objectives of my program Advancing Computer Science are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow a software development proess to analyze a problem, and to design, build and test software solutions.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language and development environment.</li>
        <li>Implement data driven solutions.</li>
        <li>Design and implement software solutions for mobile devices or embedded systems or multiple platforms.</li>
        <li>Document the planning and development of software applications using industry-standard tools, techniques, and processes.</li>
        <li>Within software solutions describe, impliment and analyze data structure techniques such as lists, trees, hash tables, graphs, along with sorting and searching algorithims.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UAT Space Program</h2>
    <h5>The CSC102 class used the UAT Space Program's data to help us hone our coding skills! Click the logo below to see an example page we made.</h5>
    <div style="height:280px;text-align: center;"> <a href="UATSpaceProgram/UATSpaceProgram.html" target="blank"> <img src="UATSpaceProgram/UATspaceLogo.jpg"></a> </div>
    <p>In this project, we had to use data from the recent UAT Space Program's launch. We had to create a place to store the data, and have an event (the buttons) to input the data.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Snake Game</h2>
    <h5>Another project I had undertaken on my own was to make a game. I settled on the classic Snake Game. Click on the image below to play!</h5>
    <div style="height:200px;text-align: center;"><a href="snakeGame/SnakeGame.html" target="blank"><img src="snakeGame/thumbnail.PNG" style="height:200px; width:400px;"></a></div>
    <p>This game definitely took some time to get working. </p>
    <p>While it may not seem like allot of work, it definitely took time to really understand how the code works together to create this game. There are allot of math elements and references that needed to be kept track of. Its definitely something I will keep in mind next time I play a game!</p>
